# what is this?

A first attempt at consolidating some of our repos, for ease of refrence/maintence in the future

# how I did this

After reading/contemplating a couple methods, I settled on this one for the inital merging:
https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-subtree-merges

Another option would be to import via submodules.
If for some reason we want to keep our current archtecture but still have a consolidated repo for refrence later that might be better.

# how to use

Since this used the subtree merge method, cloning this repo gets you all the code and history for the past repos.

# build/deploy

TBD
